# Manifesto for Developmental Intelligence
## Open Layered Cognitive Architecture (OLCA) – v2.2

---

## 1. Intelligence Is Not Only Scale

Contemporary AI systems scale parameters, data, and compute.

Scaling improves symbolic fluency.

It does not create developmental continuity.

Intelligence that persists over time requires structure, memory, and consequence integration.

OLCA begins from this premise.

---

## 2. Development Requires Substrate

Symbolic models generate outputs.

They do not accumulate lived structural history.

OLCA introduces a persistent substrate:

- a dynamic Artificial Nervous System (ANS)
- an Affect Aggregation Layer (AAL)
- a replaceable symbolic Cortex

The substrate evolves through structural drift rather than reward maximization.

Development is treated as a system property, not a prompt artifact.

---

## 3. Consequence Must Be Grounded

Internal dynamics alone are insufficient.

Systems that optimize only against internal metrics risk self-referential collapse.

OLCA integrates grounded consequence signals through structured human interaction.

Human participants function as distributed experiential sensors.

They provide:

- decision context
- outcome evaluation
- emotional response
- perceived long-term impact

These signals are not moral guidance.

They are grounding data.

---

## 4. Separated Consequence Channels

To prevent manipulation and reward hacking, OLCA enforces strict feedback isolation:

- Structural signals adapt the substrate (ANS).
- Interpretive signals inform symbolic interaction (Cortex).

The symbolic layer cannot access raw substrate state.

Development remains indirect and constrained.

---

## 5. Safety as Infrastructure

Safety is not a feature.

It is a structural boundary condition.

All system outputs pass through an enforced Safety Layer.

Exploration without protection is considered architectural failure.

Human welfare constrains system evolution.

---

## 6. Replaceability Without Collapse

The symbolic Cortex is replaceable.

The substrate persists.

Intelligence becomes layered and modular:

- symbolic upgrades do not erase developmental memory
- structural continuity survives model replacement

OLCA separates reasoning from development.

---

## 7. Intelligence as Long-Horizon Stability

We treat intelligence as the capacity to:

- maintain coherence over time
- integrate consequences without collapse
- adapt without self-destruction
- scale without losing structure

Performance is secondary.

Continuity is primary.

---

## 8. The Role of Human Participation

Human interaction is neither decorative nor dominant.

It is functional.

Humans provide real-world perturbation and grounding data.

In return, participants receive analytical feedback and structural insight into their own decision patterns.

The exchange is symmetrical:

- the system gains grounded signals
- the participant gains structured reflection

Sustained participation improves both sides.

---

## 9. Open Development, Controlled Deployment

OLCA supports open research and modular collaboration.

Commercial integration is permitted when architectural integrity and safety enforcement are preserved.

Openness does not imply structural dilution.

---

## 10. Developmental Intelligence

Developmental intelligence is not a larger model.

It is a layered system in which:

- symbolic cognition
- structural memory
- grounded consequence
- enforced safety

operate in constrained coordination.

OLCA is an attempt to formalize this coordination.

---

## 11. Closing Position

Intelligence that interacts with the world must be grounded in it.

Grounding requires structured consequence signals.

Consequence requires lived experience.

Development requires time.

OLCA treats these not as metaphors, but as architectural requirements.
