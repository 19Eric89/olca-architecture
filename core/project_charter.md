# Project Charter
## Open Layered Cognitive Architecture (OLCA)
## Human-Grounded and Safety-Aligned Developmental Intelligence v2.2

---

## 1. Purpose

This Project Charter defines the mission, scope, and operational principles of the Open Layered Cognitive Architecture (OLCA).

OLCA is a research and engineering initiative focused on building intelligence systems with persistent developmental structure, grounded consequence integration, and enforced safety constraints.

The project treats long-horizon stability as primary design objective.

---

## 2. Strategic Motivation

Contemporary AI systems achieve performance primarily through scale.

They lack durable internal history and consequence-aware adaptation.

This creates systems that are powerful but developmentally fragile.

OLCA addresses this limitation by introducing a layered substrate architecture coupled to real-world grounding signals.

---

## 3. Core Architectural Model

OLCA is based on five enforced layers:

1. Artificial Nervous System (ANS)
2. Affect Aggregation Layer (AAL)
3. Symbolic Cortex
4. Safety and Policy Enforcement Layer
5. Human Grounding Interface

These layers interact through constrained, auditable interfaces.

No layer may bypass another.

---

## 4. Role of Human Participation

Human participants function as distributed experiential sensors.

They provide structured signals describing:

- decision context
- observed outcomes
- emotional impact
- perceived long-term consequences

These signals ground substrate development.

They are not treated as normative guidance.

They are treated as developmental data.

---

## 5. Safety and Risk Management

OLCA integrates safety as architectural infrastructure.

All system outputs are mediated by an enforced Safety Layer.

Exploration that exposes participants to harm is prohibited.

Safety violations invalidate experimental results and trigger governance review.

---

## 6. Development and Research Objectives

Primary objectives:

- achieve long-term substrate coherence
- enable persistent memory formation
- maintain feedback isolation
- support symbolic model replaceability
- preserve human-grounded learning

Secondary objectives:

- build decision-support applications
- enable research partnerships
- develop deployment tooling

---

## 7. Operational Scope

OLCA development includes:

- core substrate research
- interface engineering
- safety enforcement systems
- experimental infrastructure
- documentation and governance

It excludes:

- autonomous weapons systems
- coercive surveillance platforms
- manipulative behavioral control systems

---

## 8. Governance Alignment

All project activities must comply with:

- ARCHITECTURE.md
- EXPERIMENTS.md
- HUMAN_INTEGRATION.md
- GOVERNANCE.md
- LICENSE.md

Governance decisions are binding.

---

## 9. Collaboration and Partnership Model

OLCA supports collaboration with:

- academic institutions
- industry research groups
- independent developers
- public research programs

Partnerships must preserve architectural integrity and safety enforcement.

---

## 10. Commercial and Deployment Strategy

OLCA follows an open development and controlled deployment model.

Commercial integrations are permitted when they:

- maintain safety binding
- preserve feedback isolation
- respect governance requirements
- contribute to long-horizon evaluation

Dual licensing enables sustainable development.

---

## 11. Risk Assessment

Key project risks include:

- architectural dilution
- safety circumvention
- data misuse
- premature scaling
- governance fragmentation

Mitigation strategies include strict review, auditability, and certification procedures.

---

## 12. Evaluation and Success Criteria

Project success is evaluated by:

- demonstrated long-term stability
- reproducible experimental results
- absence of critical safety incidents
- sustained contributor quality
- successful compliant deployments

Short-term performance benchmarks are not primary indicators.

---

## 13. Ethical and Legal Positioning

OLCA operates within applicable legal frameworks.

Human participation is voluntary and reversible.

The project rejects applications designed for exploitation, coercion, or mass manipulation.

---

## 14. Evolution and Review Process

This Charter is subject to periodic review.

Major revisions require:

- architectural impact analysis
- safety assessment
- governance approval

Backward compatibility must not compromise protection standards.

---

## 15. Closing Statement

OLCA is a long-horizon infrastructure project.

It treats intelligence as an emergent property of structure, grounding, and regulation.

Human experience provides developmental input.

Safety provides constraint.

Together, these elements define sustainable system evolution.
