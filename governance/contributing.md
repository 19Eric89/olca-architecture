Contributing to OLCA
Developmental and Safety-Aligned Contribution Standards v2.1
1. Purpose

This document defines contribution standards for the Open Layered Cognitive Architecture (OLCA).

Its purpose is to ensure that all technical, experimental, and conceptual contributions preserve:

architectural integrity

safety enforcement

feedback isolation

human welfare constraints

long-horizon research quality

All contributions must comply with ARCHITECTURE.md, EXPERIMENTS.md, and GOVERNANCE.md.

2. Contribution Philosophy

OLCA prioritizes depth, rigor, and structural coherence over speed and visibility.

We value:

careful design

explicit documentation

reproducible results

conservative integration

Rapid prototyping without validation is discouraged.

3. Mandatory Safety Alignment

All contributions must preserve the Safety Layer and its authority.

Contributions must not:

bypass safety enforcement

weaken risk classification

introduce prescriptive decision logic

enable uncontrolled exploration

reduce human protection mechanisms

Any change affecting user-facing behavior requires explicit safety review.

4. Architectural Integrity Requirements

Contributions must respect:

layered isolation

dual feedback channel separation

indirect coupling principles

Cortex–ANS independence

Shortcut control paths, hidden reward channels, or implicit optimization loops are prohibited.

5. Human Integration Constraints

Human participation is a structural system component.

Contributions interacting with human interfaces must:

preserve informed consent mechanisms

respect opt-out and deletion rights

avoid coercive incentive models

prevent data overcollection

Human experience must not be exploited for optimization shortcuts.

6. Experimental Standards

Experimental contributions must:

include reproducible configurations

document metrics and assumptions

declare safety boundaries

provide failure analysis

Long-horizon tests are preferred over short benchmarks.

7. Documentation and Transparency

All significant contributions must include:

architectural rationale

interface descriptions

safety impact assessment

backward compatibility notes

Undocumented structural changes will not be merged.

8. Review and Approval Process

All contributions are subject to:

architectural review

safety compliance review

governance compatibility check

High-impact changes may require multi-author approval.

9. Prohibited Practices

The following practices are not accepted:

introducing hidden optimization targets

embedding undisclosed tracking

circumventing governance controls

prioritizing performance over stability

weakening audit mechanisms

Violations may result in rejection or revocation of contribution rights.

10. Community Standards

Contributors are expected to:

engage respectfully

prioritize system integrity

disclose conflicts of interest

support long-term project health

OLCA is a research infrastructure project.

Short-term gains are not prioritized.

11. Alignment with Project Governance

All contributors acknowledge that governance decisions are binding.

Disputes regarding safety, architecture, or human impact are resolved under GOVERNANCE.md procedures.

12. Closing Statement

Contributing to OLCA requires technical competence and ethical responsibility.

Safety, transparency, and structural rigor are non-negotiable.

These standards exist to protect the project and its participants.
