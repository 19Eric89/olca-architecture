# Open Layered Cognitive Architecture (OLCA)

## A Modular Framework for Long-Horizon Intelligence Systems

---

## Overview

OLCA is a layered system architecture for coupling symbolic AI models with persistent developmental substrates and real-world grounding signals.

The framework is designed to study and build intelligence systems that exhibit:

- long-term coherence
- structural memory
- stable self-regulation
- modular upgradeability
- controlled human-in-the-loop learning

OLCA treats large language models as replaceable interface components rather than as complete intelligence systems.

## Core Concept

Modern AI systems provide powerful symbolic reasoning.

However, they lack persistent developmental structure and consequence-aware adaptation.

OLCA addresses this gap by introducing a substrate-based architecture with separated learning channels.

At a high level:

```
ANS → AAL → Cortex → Safety → Human
         ↑                    ↓
         AAL ← Structured Feedback
         ↓
        ANS
```

Human interaction supplies grounded experiential data.

This data is transformed into long-horizon structural signals.

## Architectural Layers

### Artificial Nervous System (ANS)

The ANS provides persistent internal dynamics and long-term memory formation.

It operates without explicit reward optimization.

### Affect Aggregation Layer (AAL)

The AAL compresses high-dimensional system and human signals into stable affective representations.

It maintains isolated processing channels for substrate adaptation and symbolic interpretation.

### Symbolic Cortex

The Cortex layer hosts large language models or agent systems.

It provides reasoning, dialogue, and interpretation capabilities.

Cortex modules are replaceable and versioned.

### Safety & Policy Layer

The Safety Layer mediates all external outputs.

It enforces risk constraints and domain restrictions.

### Human Interface

Human participants provide structured experiential input.

These signals function as real-world grounding and perturbation data.

---

## Human Participation Model

Human participants act as distributed experience sensors.

They provide:

- decision context
- outcome assessment
- emotional response
- consequence evaluation

These inputs are processed as training signals for substrate adaptation.

In return, participants receive:

- personalized analytical feedback
- pattern detection reports
- decision-support insights
- longitudinal development metrics

Sustained participation improves both personal utility and system performance.

---

## Learning and Feedback Isolation

OLCA implements separated consequence channels:

- Structural Channel → ANS (hidden)
- Interpretive Channel → Cortex (visible)

This prevents reward hacking and internal manipulation.

Learning occurs through structural drift rather than direct optimization.

---

## Experimental Orientation

OLCA prioritizes architectural research over task benchmarks.

Primary research domains include:

- substrate stability
- memory persistence
- coupling dynamics
- isolation integrity
- scalability limits

Human input is treated as controlled experimental stimulus.

---

## Scalability Model

Symbolic capability scales through model development.

Developmental stability scales through substrate replication.

No exponential retraining dependency is required once stable primitives exist.

---

## Use Cases

- Long-horizon AI research
- Human-grounded learning systems
- Decision-support platforms
- Cognitive infrastructure prototyping
- Alignment and safety research

- GOVERNANCE.md — Authority and compliance framework
- LICENSE.md — Usage and distribution terms

---

## Contribution Model

OLCA welcomes contributions in:

- substrate implementations
- aggregation methods
- interface tooling
- evaluation frameworks
- safety mechanisms

All contributions must comply with architectural and governance standards.

---

## Licensing and Commercial Use

OLCA is designed for both open research and commercial deployment.

Commercial integrations must preserve:

- safety enforcement
- feedback isolation
- auditability

See LICENSE.md for details.

---

## Research Positioning

OLCA investigates intelligence as a system property emerging from:

- persistent structure
- grounded feedback
- modular cognition
- controlled adaptation

It does not attempt to replace existing AI paradigms.

It extends them with developmental infrastructure.

---

## Status

OLCA is an active research and engineering project.

Interfaces and protocols may evolve.

Backward compatibility is prioritized for substrate layers.

---

## Contact and Collaboration

Research groups, industry partners, and independent developers are invited to collaborate.

Partnerships focus on:

- long-horizon evaluation
- scalable deployments
- infrastructure integration

Open discussion and peer review are encouraged.
